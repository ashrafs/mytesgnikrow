Description: sdpy is an umbrella package of C++ and Python modules useful for
        computer science. The package have been mainly being developed by
        Minh-Tri Pham, as part of his Ph.D. research. Since his research area
        is about face detection, you will find many useful modules for computer
        vision and machine learning, especially boosting techniques,
        Haar-like features, and face detection (i.e. (rotation-invariant) frontal
        face).
